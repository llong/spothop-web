Use MUI components to create components - follow latest documentation: https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/
Remember the Grid component from MUI does not have an item prop and for sizing it uses a "size" prop object ie: size={{sm:12,md:6}}

when creating sprints each tast should be numbered
when creating commits - prefix the commit message with the sprint number and task number as well as a task type eg(fix, feat, chore, doc) etc.

a sprintX.md file must be created for every sprint. You will plan with the developer on what the sprint will focus on and create appropriate tasks for that sprint. Commits will be created for each task to make it easier to track changes and progress.

You should have MCP access to Supabase to verify backend configuration. If you cannot access you should inform the developer.
