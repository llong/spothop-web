Use MUI components to create components - follow latest documentation: https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/
Remember the Grid component from MUI does not have an item prop and for sizing it uses a "size" prop object ie: size={{sm:12,md:6}}

when creating sprints each tast should be numbered
when creating commits - prefix the commit message with the sprint number and task number as well as a task type eg(fix, feat, chore, doc) etc.
