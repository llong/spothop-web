- Use MUI library and follow latest documentation: https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/

- Use MUI theming api whenever possible to apply consistent styling standards throughout the app

- Use flat design principles and avoid using shadows unless explicitly told by the user to do so. Use built-in props, css classes and theme api to keep styling consistent and scaleable.
